# Applied-Machine-Learning
This Rebo contains all projects in subject Applied Machine Learning that I worked on during my master in Ottawa University.
#### The Final Project: Forest Cover Type Prediction
It is a supervised machine learning classification problem. The objective is to predict the forest cover type (represented as integers) for each 30m x 30m patch in the forest, based on various geographical and environmental features.

### Models 
Apply these five algorithms, Plot confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy for each model: 
- KNN 
- LogisticRegression
- SVM 
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- Naive Bayes Classifier 

### Conclusion
Decision Tree is the baseline as it achieves the best performance with highest testing accuracy of 76% 
- KNN is the second best ML model with 73% of testing accuracy

- Dimensionality reduction and feature selection process using Sequential Feature Selector (SFS) with Decision Tree (DT) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers could improve the accuracy slightly to the accuracy of the baseline.

- After the last calculations in Q2 and Q3 we found out that the Champion model is Random Forest Classifier with accuracy score 81.5% when number of features(K) = 21

- we implement PKI and plot the accuracy vs. number of neurons and notice that accracy does not improve than baseline Random Forest accuracy
